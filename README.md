# WEEK6_HTTP_AND_AUTH

This folder contains code and resources related to HTTP, authentication, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in Node.js. It is designed for learning and experimenting with authentication mechanisms and HTTP server basics.

## Contents

- **index.js**: Main server file. Likely sets up an HTTP server and demonstrates authentication flows.
- **2.js**: Additional server or utility code related to HTTP/authentication.
- **jwt.js**: Demonstrates usage of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- **jwt2.js**: Alternative or extended JWT example.
- **links.txt**: Contains useful links or references for HTTP and authentication topics.
- **public/**: Contains static files (e.g., `index.html`) served by the server.

## How to Use

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed).
2. Run the server (e.g., `node index.js` or `node 2.js`).
3. Access the application via your browser at the specified port (default is usually 3000 or 8000).
4. Explore JWT authentication by running `jwt.js` or `jwt2.js` as needed.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand HTTP server basics in Node.js.
- Learn about authentication mechanisms.
- Implement and experiment with JWT for stateless authentication.
